## Folder Structure

For the instructions below, the use of `REPO_ROOT` will refer to the fully qualified directory path where the repository is cloned.

- `REPO_ROOT/`
  - `data`: Data files
  - `figures`: Figures and table files generated by code
  - `report`: Latex report files
  - `src`: Python code and Jupyter notebooks

## Minimum Setup Instructions

The following instructions assume you have `python` installed.

### Conda

Recommended for complete python environment isolation.

1. [Install conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
2. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. `conda activate uor-msc-dissertation-xai-african-storms`

### Venv

1. `pip install venv`
2. `python -m venv venv`
3. `source venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Description

### Storm Database:
- file: East_Africa_tracked_MCSs_2014_2019_longer_than_3_hours.csv
- 27,982 storms longer than 3 hours and that had all storm centroids along the track within (3-15N, 34-52E)

### ERA5 Data:
- ERA5 data for 31-53E, 2-16N region for 2014-2019, in total 27 GB. The ERA5 area is wider by a few grid points for edge cases in the database + for calculating gradients

#### Folder Structure
- `raw/` - no data here, Eliza has all the preprocessed data on her own jasmin gsw
- `std/` - all preprocessed data is stored here, should be in the same format, some variables are on different grids (T vs U grid)
- `processed/` - I advise to save processed data in this directory, e.g. gradients etc so we donâ€™t accidentally overwrite std/ data

#### Invariant Data:
- `geop.nc` - geopotential (m2/s2), divide by 9.81 m/s to get orography
- `lsm.nc` - land-sea mask

#### Hourly data stored in yearly files:
- `cape_0_*.nc` - convective available potential energy (J/kg)
- `olr_toa_*.nc` - top-of-atmosphere outgoing longwave flux (proxy for convection/clouds) (W/m2)
- `prcp_tot_*.nc` - thickness of rainfall amount (m) (hourly accumulations)
- `rhum_*_*.nc` - relative humidity (%) at 500, 750 and 900 hPa [was used for theta e calculations]
- `shum_*_*.nc` - specific humidity (kg/kg) at 200, 500, 850 hPa
- `skt_sfc_*.nc` - surface temperature on land (K)
- `sst_sfc_*.nc` - sea surface temperature (K)
- `swvl1_d1_*.nc` - volumetric soil water layer 1 (m3/m3)
- `swvl2_d2_*.nc` - volumetric soil water layer 2 (m3/m3)
- `ta_*_*.nc` - air temperature (K) at 500, 750 and 900 hPa [was used for theta e calculations]
- `tcwv_tot_*.nc` - thickness of atmosphere mass content of water vapor (kg/m2) [total column water vapor]
- `thetae_*_*.nc` - equivalent potential temperature (K) at 500, 750 and 900 hP; first calculated dewpoint, then LCL temperature and finally theta e (all done using metpy library, ask Eliza for code if needed)
- `uwnd_*_*.nc` - zonal wind at 200, 500 and 850 hPa
- `vwnd_*_*.nc` - meridional wind at 200, 500 and 850 hPa
