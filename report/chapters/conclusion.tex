\section{Future Work}
In addition to the findings presented in this thesis, several avenues for future research can be identified. These include but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploring the use of alternative machine learning algorithms and architectures to improve predictive performance.
    \item Investigating the incorporation of additional data sources, such as satellite imagery precipitation data, as with the original paper \citep{Hill2023}.
    \item Conducting further analysis on the interpretability of model predictions, potentially through the use of more advanced explainability techniques.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Investigating anomalous individual predictions using decision plots or force plots to quantify edge cases for the models.
    \end{itemize}
