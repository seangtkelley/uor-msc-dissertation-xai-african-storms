%     \item If your project aims to implement an algorithm for its analysis, the results may be the performance of the algorithm obtained using a relevant experiment design. 
    
%     \item If your project aims to solve some problems/research questions over a collected dataset, the results may be the findings obtained using the applied tools/algorithms/etc. 
% \end{itemize}
% Arrange your results and findings in a logical sequence.
