\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

- the importance of MCSs in East Africa but that direct research is lacking
- the open access to global reanalysis datasets for meteorological research
- existing research shows potential for data-driven ml methods to help in identifying key factors influencing storm behaviour

\section{Research Objectives}

The primary objectives of this research are to investigate the factors which contribute to the intensification and propagation of East African \acrfullpl{mcs} through the usage of an interpretable machine learning model and subsequent application of explainable AI techniques. 

- first, data preprocessing
- model training
- then, explainable AI techniques
