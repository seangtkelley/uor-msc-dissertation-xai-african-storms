\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:con}

% Typically a conclusions chapter first summarizes the investigated problem and its aims and objectives. It summaries the critical/significant/major findings/results about the aims and objectives that have been obtained by applying the key methods/implementations/experiment set-ups. A conclusions chapter draws a picture/outline of your project's central and the most signification contributions and achievements. 

% A good conclusions summary could be approximately 300--500 words long, but this is just a recommendation.

% A conclusions chapter followed by an abstract is the last things you write in your project report.
