\section{Experimental Results Overview}

This section provides an overview of the experimental results obtained from the various predictive tasks outlined in the methodology. The results are categorised based on the type of prediction: storm aggregate features and immediate characteristics at an observation. 

\section{Predict Storm Aggregate Features}

These experiments aim to predict the overall characteristics of a storm based on its initial observation.

\subsection{Storm Max Intensity}

Table \ref{tab:storm_max_intensity_results} details the performance metrics for storm max intensity prediction across different experimental setups as specified in the methodology. Note that the target predictand was \texttt{storm\_min\_bt} so lower values indicate stronger storms.

The key observations include: \todo{make a paragraph}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ERA5 features alone perform comparably to all features
    \item Using only the first points results in a substantial drop in performance
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Experiment results for storm max intensity prediction}
\label{tab:storm_max_intensity_results}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\hline
\textbf{Experiment} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{RMSE}} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Target Std}} & \textbf{Actual vs. Predicted $R^2$} \\
\cline{2-5}
 & \textbf{All} & \textbf{First pts} & \textbf{All} & \textbf{First pts} &  \\
\hline
All              & 2.7610 & 4.4872 & 9.1679 & 8.8540 & 0.9098 \\
\acrshort{era5}             & 2.7503 & 4.1075 & 9.1679 & 8.8540 & 0.9134 \\
All First Points & \multicolumn{2}{c}{7.2265} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{8.9432} & 0.3478 \\
\acrshort{era5} First Points & \multicolumn{2}{c}{7.4673} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{8.9432} & 0.3034 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Due to the poor performance of the first points only models, further explainability analysis will focus on the all observations models.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/generated/experiments/storm_max_intensity/storm_max_intensity_summary.png}
    \caption{Comparison of performance and top features for storm max intensity.}
    \label{fig:storm_max_intensity_summary}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:storm_max_intensity_summary} presents a detailed comparison of the model performance and the most influential features for predicting storm max intensity using all features versus \acrshort{era5} only.

The key observations include: \todo{make a paragraph}
\begin{itemize}
    \item only one meteorological variable in top 5 for all features model from c)
    \item diurnal cycle is clear with stronger storms developing in late evening from c)
    \item \acrshort{cape} is reliably the most important meteorological factor from c) and d)
\end{itemize}

Particularly notable for these models is that the importance of low-level meridional winds changes with time of day, date, and location. Figure \ref{fig:storm_max_intensity_era5_shap_mean_v850_map_by_month} illustrates this variability over the study region throughout the year. During the summer months, the influence is predominantly positive over the Somali coastal plains and negative over the Ethiopian Highlands, indicating a diminishing effect on storm intensity in the southeast. Conversely, in the winter months, the influence tends to be negative or neutral over the entire domain.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Storm Direction}

Table \ref{tab:storm_direction_results} details the performance metrics for storm direction prediction across different experimental setups as specified in the methodology.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Experiment results for storm direction prediction}
\label{tab:storm_direction_results}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\hline
\textbf{Experiment} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{RMSE}} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Target Std}} & \textbf{Actual vs. Predicted $R^2$} \\
\cline{2-5}
 & \textbf{All} & \textbf{First pts} & \textbf{All} & \textbf{First pts} &  \\
\hline
storm\_direction\_all              & 21.8881 & 36.4077 & 75.7506 & 76.8966 & 0.9192 \\
storm\_direction\_era5             & 18.2928 & 31.6709 & 75.7506 & 76.8966 & 0.9437 \\
storm\_direction\_all\_first\_points & \multicolumn{2}{c}{61.3329} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{78.7438} & 0.3937 \\
storm\_direction\_era5\_first\_points & \multicolumn{2}{c}{61.4484} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{78.7438} & 0.3912 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Again, due to the poor performance of the first points only models, further explainability analysis will focus on the all observations models.

For better context in interpreting the meaning of the \acrshort{shap} values, Figure \ref{fig:storm_cardinal_directions_distribution} shows the distribution of storm cardinal directions in the dataset. The distribution indicates that the majority of storms move in a westerly direction. Thus, generally for this experiment, positive \acrshort{shap} values can be interpreted as shifting the predicted storm direction northward, while negative values indicate a southward shift.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../figures/generated/exploration/storm_cardinal_directions_distribution.png}
    \caption{Distribution of storm cardinal directions in the dataset.}
    \label{fig:storm_cardinal_directions_distribution}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/generated/experiments/storm_direction/storm_direction_summary.png}
    \caption{Comparison of performance and top features for storm direction.}
    \label{fig:storm_direction_summary}
\end{figure}

Low-level zonal winds are by far the most important factor for predicting storm direction, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:storm_direction_summary} c) and d). Positive values of \texttt{mean\_u850} (westerly winds) tend to shift the predicted storm direction eastward. \texttt{eat\_hours} does not appear in the top 12 features indicating that diurnal cycle is not a significant factor for storm direction.

Mid-level zonal winds also appear to be important, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:storm_direction_era5_shap_mean_u500_map_by_month}. The influence of these winds varies with location and time of year. During the summer months, the influence is predominantly negative over the Somali coastal plains and positive over the Ethiopian Highlands. During the end of the year, the influence appears mostly neutral over the entire domain. However, in the spring, the influence is the summer influence but mirrored horizontally, with negative values over the Gulf of Aden and positive values on the Ethiopian border with South Sudan and Kenya.
