\chapter*{\center \Large  Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my primary supervisor, Dr. Eliza Karlowska, for her invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout this project. I would also like to thank my secondary supervisors, Assoc. Prof. Kieran Hunt and Prof. Andy Turner, for contributing significant time and expertise.

Thank you to my family for your love, encouragement, and for always believing in me. Finally, I must acknowledge the truly unwavering support of my partner. I could not have done this without you.
