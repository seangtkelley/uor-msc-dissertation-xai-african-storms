   abstract = {Low-pressure systems (LPSs) are the primary rainbringers of the South Asian monsoon. Yet, their interactions with the large-scale monsoon circulation, as well as the highly variable land and sea surfaces they pass over, are complex and generally not well understood. In this article, we present a novel, top-down approach to investigate these relationships and quantify their importance in describing LPS behaviour. We also show that, if the approach is sufficiently well posed, it is productive at hypothesis generation. For each of five predictands (i.e., LPS intensification rate, propagation speed/direction, post-landfall survival, peak intensity, and precipitation rate) we train an additive decision-tree ensemble model using the XGBoost algorithm. Shapley value analysis is then applied to the models to determine which variables are important predictors and to establish their relationship with the predictand, with additional analysis following cases of interest. Novel relationships established using this technique include that LPS vorticity intensifies preferentially in the early morning at the same time as the peak in the diurnal cycle of their convection occurs, that vertical wind shear suppresses continued growth of strong LPSs, that large-scale barotropic instability plays an important role in both the inland penetration and peak intensity of LPSs, and that LPS propagation depends on the depth of its vortex with shallower LPSs advected by low-level winds and taller LPSs advected by mid-level winds. We also use this framework to identify and discuss potential new avenues of research for monsoon LPSs.},

   abstract = {In East Africa, climate change and variability have shown a strong impact on sectors such as agriculture, energy, and water. To allow mitigation and adaptation of the possible impacts of the projected change in climate, this study applies a Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM)to generate a high-resolution climate projection, equivalent to future station data, to drive impact assessment models in selected, agricultural intensive, basins of Ethiopia (EthShed), Kenya (KenShed), and Tanzania (TanShed). Observed and large-scale climate variables (predictors)are obtained from the national meteorological agency of Ethiopia and international databases. BROOK90, a physical-based hydrological model, is used to assess the impacts of the projected change in precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature (T-max, and T-min)on the water balance. Based on SDSM, the results show an increase in precipitation, relative to the baseline period (1961–1990), in EthShed (14% - 50%)and KenShed (15% - 86%)and a decrease in TanShed (1.3% - 6.3%)in the 20s (2011–2040), 50s (2041–2070), and 80s (2071–2100)under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). T-max (anomalies up to 3.7 °C)and T-min (anomalies up to 2.76 °C)will be warmer than the baseline period throughout the 21 century in all three basins. In line with the projected change in precipitation and temperature, an increase (decrease)in seasonal and annual streamflow, soil-water, and evaporation in EthShed and KenShed (TanShed)is projected in the 20s, 50s, and 80s. In general, sustainable adaptation measures are required to be developed in a site-specific manner, considering the projected increase in temperature and evaporation in all three basins and a decrease in soil-water and streamflow in TanShed.},

   abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the largescale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Yang2015,
   abstract = {East African precipitation is characterized by a dry annual mean climatology compared to other deep tropical land areas and a bimodal annual cycle with the major rainy season during March-May (MAM; often called the "long rains") and the second during October-December (OND; often called the "short rains"). To explore these distinctive features, ERA-Interim data are used to analyze the associated annual cycles of atmospheric convective stability, circulation, and moisture budget. The atmosphere over East Africa is found to be convectively stable in general year-round but with an annual cycle dominated by the surface moist static energy (MSE), which is in phase with the precipitation annual cycle. Throughout the year, the atmospheric circulation is dominated by a pattern of convergence near the surface, divergence in the lower troposphere, and convergence again at upper levels. Consistently, the convergence of the vertically integrated moisture flux is mostly negative across the year, but becomes weakly positive in the two rainy seasons. It is suggested that the semiarid/arid climate in East Africa and its bimodal precipitation annual cycle can be explained by the ventilation mechanism, in which the atmospheric convective stability over East Africa is controlled by the import of low MSE air from the relatively cool Indian Ocean off the coast. During the rainy seasons, however, the off-coast sea surface temperature (SST) increases (and is warmest during the long rains season) and consequently the air imported into East Africa becomes less stable. This analysis may be used to aid in understanding overestimates of the East African short rains commonly found in coupled models.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs), tropical storms (TSs), and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are important weather phenomena that often threaten society through heavy precipitation and strong winds. Despite their potentially vital role in global and regional hydrological cycles, their contributions to long-term mean and extreme precipitation have not been systematically explored at the global scale. Using observational and reanalysis data, and NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s new high-resolution global climate model, we quantify that despite their occasional (13%) occurrence globally, AR, TS, and MCS days together account for ∼55% of global mean precipitation and ∼75% of extreme precipitation with daily rates exceeding its local 99th percentile. The model reproduces well the observed percentage of mean and extreme precipitation associated with AR, TS, and MCS days. In an idealized global warming simulation with a homogeneous SST increase of 4 K, the modeled changes in global mean and regional distribution of precipitation correspond well with changes in AR/TS/MCS precipitation. Globally, the frequency of AR days increases and migrates toward higher latitudes while the frequency of TS days increases over the central Pacific and part of the south Indian Ocean with a decrease elsewhere. The frequency of MCS days tends to increase over parts of the equatorial western and eastern Pacific warm pools and high latitudes and decreases over most part of the tropics and subtropics. The AR/TS/MCS mean precipitation intensity increases by ∼5% K21 due primarily to precipitation increases in the top 25% of AR/TS/MCS days with the heaviest precipitation, which are dominated by the thermodynamic component with the dynamic and microphysical components playing a secondary role.},

   abstract = {East Africa is particularly vulnerable to weather extremes, with severe weather linked to thousands of deaths per year. Improved forecasts of convective events in this region are urgently needed, from both nowcasting and numerical weather prediction models. Improving these forecasts requires further knowledge of convection in this region. This study aims to improve understanding of convective events in East Africa, based on a six-year climatology of convective life cycles and the associated precipitation. Convective systems are identified as contiguous areas of cold cloud in geostationary satellite measurements over East Africa. A tracking algorithm is used to trace the evolution of the properties of these systems through time and space. Matching the systems to surface precipitation obtained from satellite microwave observations provides insight into how the life cycles of these systems relate to precipitation at the surface. Over the region as a whole, 59% of the accumulated precipitation can be attributed to the tracked convective systems. The majority (81%) of heavy precipitation events ((Formula presented.) 10 mm (Formula presented.) hr−1) are attributable to convective systems, while light rainfall events ((Formula presented.) 1 mm (Formula presented.) hr−1) are not (1.8%). Most of the tracked convective systems have an area less than 400 km2 and last for less than an hour. However, the less frequent larger longer-lived systems produce the majority of the regional accumulated precipitation. Composite life cycles of the tracked systems show rapid intensification and the heaviest precipitation initially, followed by a steady increase in area and weakening in intensity before the system decays. Finally, the Madden–Julian oscillation, which plays a key role in intraseasonal rainfall variability in the region, is also linked to the amount of rainfall due to convective systems through changes in the frequency and properties of these systems.},
