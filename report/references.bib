   abstract = {Low-pressure systems (LPSs) are the primary rainbringers of the South Asian monsoon. Yet, their interactions with the large-scale monsoon circulation, as well as the highly variable land and sea surfaces they pass over, are complex and generally not well understood. In this article, we present a novel, top-down approach to investigate these relationships and quantify their importance in describing LPS behaviour. We also show that, if the approach is sufficiently well posed, it is productive at hypothesis generation. For each of five predictands (i.e., LPS intensification rate, propagation speed/direction, post-landfall survival, peak intensity, and precipitation rate) we train an additive decision-tree ensemble model using the XGBoost algorithm. Shapley value analysis is then applied to the models to determine which variables are important predictors and to establish their relationship with the predictand, with additional analysis following cases of interest. Novel relationships established using this technique include that LPS vorticity intensifies preferentially in the early morning at the same time as the peak in the diurnal cycle of their convection occurs, that vertical wind shear suppresses continued growth of strong LPSs, that large-scale barotropic instability plays an important role in both the inland penetration and peak intensity of LPSs, and that LPS propagation depends on the depth of its vortex with shallower LPSs advected by low-level winds and taller LPSs advected by mid-level winds. We also use this framework to identify and discuss potential new avenues of research for monsoon LPSs.},

   abstract = {In East Africa, climate change and variability have shown a strong impact on sectors such as agriculture, energy, and water. To allow mitigation and adaptation of the possible impacts of the projected change in climate, this study applies a Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM)to generate a high-resolution climate projection, equivalent to future station data, to drive impact assessment models in selected, agricultural intensive, basins of Ethiopia (EthShed), Kenya (KenShed), and Tanzania (TanShed). Observed and large-scale climate variables (predictors)are obtained from the national meteorological agency of Ethiopia and international databases. BROOK90, a physical-based hydrological model, is used to assess the impacts of the projected change in precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature (T-max, and T-min)on the water balance. Based on SDSM, the results show an increase in precipitation, relative to the baseline period (1961–1990), in EthShed (14% - 50%)and KenShed (15% - 86%)and a decrease in TanShed (1.3% - 6.3%)in the 20s (2011–2040), 50s (2041–2070), and 80s (2071–2100)under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). T-max (anomalies up to 3.7 °C)and T-min (anomalies up to 2.76 °C)will be warmer than the baseline period throughout the 21 century in all three basins. In line with the projected change in precipitation and temperature, an increase (decrease)in seasonal and annual streamflow, soil-water, and evaporation in EthShed and KenShed (TanShed)is projected in the 20s, 50s, and 80s. In general, sustainable adaptation measures are required to be developed in a site-specific manner, considering the projected increase in temperature and evaporation in all three basins and a decrease in soil-water and streamflow in TanShed.},

   abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the largescale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {East African precipitation is characterized by a dry annual mean climatology compared to other deep tropical land areas and a bimodal annual cycle with the major rainy season during March-May (MAM; often called the "long rains") and the second during October-December (OND; often called the "short rains"). To explore these distinctive features, ERA-Interim data are used to analyze the associated annual cycles of atmospheric convective stability, circulation, and moisture budget. The atmosphere over East Africa is found to be convectively stable in general year-round but with an annual cycle dominated by the surface moist static energy (MSE), which is in phase with the precipitation annual cycle. Throughout the year, the atmospheric circulation is dominated by a pattern of convergence near the surface, divergence in the lower troposphere, and convergence again at upper levels. Consistently, the convergence of the vertically integrated moisture flux is mostly negative across the year, but becomes weakly positive in the two rainy seasons. It is suggested that the semiarid/arid climate in East Africa and its bimodal precipitation annual cycle can be explained by the ventilation mechanism, in which the atmospheric convective stability over East Africa is controlled by the import of low MSE air from the relatively cool Indian Ocean off the coast. During the rainy seasons, however, the off-coast sea surface temperature (SST) increases (and is warmest during the long rains season) and consequently the air imported into East Africa becomes less stable. This analysis may be used to aid in understanding overestimates of the East African short rains commonly found in coupled models.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs), tropical storms (TSs), and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are important weather phenomena that often threaten society through heavy precipitation and strong winds. Despite their potentially vital role in global and regional hydrological cycles, their contributions to long-term mean and extreme precipitation have not been systematically explored at the global scale. Using observational and reanalysis data, and NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s new high-resolution global climate model, we quantify that despite their occasional (13%) occurrence globally, AR, TS, and MCS days together account for ∼55% of global mean precipitation and ∼75% of extreme precipitation with daily rates exceeding its local 99th percentile. The model reproduces well the observed percentage of mean and extreme precipitation associated with AR, TS, and MCS days. In an idealized global warming simulation with a homogeneous SST increase of 4 K, the modeled changes in global mean and regional distribution of precipitation correspond well with changes in AR/TS/MCS precipitation. Globally, the frequency of AR days increases and migrates toward higher latitudes while the frequency of TS days increases over the central Pacific and part of the south Indian Ocean with a decrease elsewhere. The frequency of MCS days tends to increase over parts of the equatorial western and eastern Pacific warm pools and high latitudes and decreases over most part of the tropics and subtropics. The AR/TS/MCS mean precipitation intensity increases by ∼5% K21 due primarily to precipitation increases in the top 25% of AR/TS/MCS days with the heaviest precipitation, which are dominated by the thermodynamic component with the dynamic and microphysical components playing a secondary role.},

   abstract = {East Africa is particularly vulnerable to weather extremes, with severe weather linked to thousands of deaths per year. Improved forecasts of convective events in this region are urgently needed, from both nowcasting and numerical weather prediction models. Improving these forecasts requires further knowledge of convection in this region. This study aims to improve understanding of convective events in East Africa, based on a six-year climatology of convective life cycles and the associated precipitation. Convective systems are identified as contiguous areas of cold cloud in geostationary satellite measurements over East Africa. A tracking algorithm is used to trace the evolution of the properties of these systems through time and space. Matching the systems to surface precipitation obtained from satellite microwave observations provides insight into how the life cycles of these systems relate to precipitation at the surface. Over the region as a whole, 59% of the accumulated precipitation can be attributed to the tracked convective systems. The majority (81%) of heavy precipitation events ((Formula presented.) 10 mm (Formula presented.) hr−1) are attributable to convective systems, while light rainfall events ((Formula presented.) 1 mm (Formula presented.) hr−1) are not (1.8%). Most of the tracked convective systems have an area less than 400 km2 and last for less than an hour. However, the less frequent larger longer-lived systems produce the majority of the regional accumulated precipitation. Composite life cycles of the tracked systems show rapid intensification and the heaviest precipitation initially, followed by a steady increase in area and weakening in intensity before the system decays. Finally, the Madden–Julian oscillation, which plays a key role in intraseasonal rainfall variability in the region, is also linked to the amount of rainfall due to convective systems through changes in the frequency and properties of these systems.},

   abstract = {Since 1982, extreme daily rainfall in the western Sahel has increased persistently, owing to a warmer Sahara which has led to increased wind shear and an increase in intense storms. A warming climate is expected to increase the frequency of extreme rainfall events because warmer air can support higher humidity, but other mechanisms may also be at work. Christopher Taylor et al. show that increases in extreme rainfall in the western Sahel region of Africa since 1982 are driven by a larger gradient in temperature across the region caused by a warmer Sahara desert to the north. In turn, the sharper gradient increases wind shear and seems to have led to the frequency of mesoscale convective systems—which are exactly the kind of weather systems likely to generate extreme rainfall—tripling since 1982. The spatial patterns of global warming are likely to further increase the temperature gradient and intensify mesoscale convective systems, leading to more extreme rainfall events. The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify under global warming1, with studies reporting more frequent extreme rain events in many regions of the world2,3,4, and predicting increases in future flood frequency5. Such early, predominantly mid-latitude observations are essential because of shortcomings within climate models in their depiction of convective rainfall6,7. A globally important group of intense storms—mesoscale convective systems (MCSs)8—poses a particular challenge, because they organize dynamically on spatial scales that cannot be resolved by conventional climate models. Here, we use 35 years of satellite observations from the West African Sahel to reveal a persistent increase in the frequency of the most intense MCSs. Sahelian storms are some of the most powerful on the planet9, and rain gauges in this region have recorded a rise in ‘extreme’17 daily rainfall totals. We find that intense MCS frequency is only weakly related to the multidecadal recovery of Sahel annual rainfall, but is highly correlated with global land temperatures. Analysis of trends across Africa reveals that MCS intensification is limited to a narrow band south of the Sahara desert. During this period, wet-season Sahelian temperatures have not risen, ruling out the possibility that rainfall has intensified in response to locally warmer conditions. On the other hand, the meridional temperature gradient spanning the Sahel has increased in recent decades, consistent with anthropogenic forcing driving enhanced Saharan warming10. We argue that Saharan warming intensifies convection within Sahelian MCSs through increased wind shear and changes to the Saharan air layer. The meridional gradient is projected to strengthen throughout the twenty-first century, suggesting that the Sahel will experience particularly marked increases in extreme rain. The remarkably rapid intensification of Sahelian MCSs since the 1980s sheds new light on the response of organized tropical convection to global warming, and challenges conventional projections made by general circulation models.},

   abstract = {The modulation of the rainfall diurnal cycle at intraseasonal and interannual time scales is examined using gridded rainfall data over Eastern Africa and the nearby Indian Ocean for the period 1998–2014. Our focus is on the October-December season which is strongly impacted by both the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (IODM). The effect of the MJO, which is not synchronized across the whole region, is mainly through changes in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, especially an enhancement of the late afternoon peak in active phases of the MJO. The rainfall phase only shows minor variations between the active and quiescent phases of the MJO, except over the drier regions and the Indian Ocean where the overall diurnal rainfall signal is more uneven. The effect of the positive phase of the IODM (warm western Indian Ocean) on Eastern Africa rainfall is found at any time of the day, but the enhancement is more prominent during the wettest part of the day (generally the afternoon). Substantial changes in the diurnal phase of the rains are found in some land areas away from the coast or from mountain ranges, where the dominant afternoon peak during the negative IODM phase is replaced by a nighttime maximum during the positive phase. Cross-sections and a cluster analysis of diurnal rainfall patterns over Kenya and southern Somalia suggest that this feature may be associated with the development of longer-lived rainfall systems propagating inland from the coast during the IODM positive phase.},

   abstract = {The largest convective clouds are mesoscale convective systems, which account for a large portion of Earth's cloud cover and precipitation, and the patterns of wind and weather associated with mesoscale convective systems are important local phenomena that often must be forecast on short timescales. They often produce floods. Mesoscale convective systems are generally much larger than the individual cumulonimbus and lines of cumulonimbus discussed in Chapter 8. They develop circulations on the mesoscale, which are larger in scale than the updrafts and downdrafts of individual cumulonimbus clouds. The mesoscale circulations produce large regions of stratiform (nimbostratus) precipitation of the type discussed in Chapter 6. Often the stratiform precipitation regions trail a squall line consisting of convective cells, and a mesoscale convective vortex tends to form in the stratiform region. The heating profile in the stratiform region is positive at upper levels and negative at lower levels due to evaporation and melting of the precipitation particles. The dynamics of mesoscale circulations involve a joint adjustment to the wind shear and thermodynamic stratification of the large scale environment. Gravity-wave dynamics also contribute to the maintenance of mesoscale convective systems.

   abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are the major source of extreme rainfall over land in the tropics and are expected to intensify with global warming. In the Sahel, changes in surface temperature gradients and associated changes in wind shear have been found to be important for MCS intensification in recent decades. Here we extend that analysis to southern West Africa (SWA) by combining 34 years of cloud-top temperatures with rainfall and reanalysis data. We identify clear trends in intense MCSs since 1983 and their associated atmospheric drivers. We also find a marked annual cycle in the drivers, linked to changes in the convective regime during the progression of the West African monsoon. Before the peak of the first rainy season, we identify a shear regime where increased temperature gradients play a crucial role for MCS intensity trends. From June onward, SWA moves into a less unstable, moist regime during which MCS trends are mainly linked to frequency increase and may be more influenced by total column water vapor. However, during both seasons we find that MCSs with the most intense convection occur in an environment with stronger wind shear, increased low-level humidity, and drier midlevels. Comparing the sensitivity of MCS intensity and peak rainfall to low-level moisture and wind shear conditions preceding events, we find a dominant role for wind shear. We conclude that MCS trends are directly linked to a strengthening of two distinct convective regimes that cause the seasonal change of SWA MCS characteristics. However, the convective environment that ultimately produces the most intense MCSs remains the same.},

Additionally, hourly precipitation data from 16 of those years (2002-17) are used to systematically examine rainfall associated with radar-derived MCS events. The attributes and occurrence of MCSs that pass over portions of the CONUS east of the Continental Divide (ECONUS), as well as five author-defined subregions-North Plains, High Plains, Corn Belt, Northeast, and Mid-South-are also examined. The results illustrate two preferred regions for MCS activity in the ECONUS: 1) the Mid-South and Gulf Coast and 2) the Central Plains and Midwest. MCS occurrence and MCS rainfall display a marked seasonal cycle, with most of the regions experiencing these events primarily during the warm season (May-August). Additionally, MCS rainfall was responsible for over 50% of annual and seasonal rainfall for many locations in the ECONUS. Of particular importance, the majority of warm-season rainfall for regions with high agricultural land use (Corn Belt) and important aquifer recharge properties (High Plains) is attributable to MCSs. These results reaffirm that MCSs are a significant aspect of the ECONUS hydroclimate.},

This paper shows the results of a systematic search through seven full years of the TRMM database to find indicators of uncommonly intense storms. These include strong (> 40 dBZ) radar echoes extending to great heights, high lightning flash rates, and very low brightness temperatures at 37 and 85 GHz. These are used as proxy variables, indicating powerful convective updrafts. The main physical principles supporting this assertion involve the effects of such updrafts in producing and lofting large ice particles high into the storm, where TRMM's radar easily detects them near storm top. TRMM's passive microwave radiometer detects the large integrated ice water path as very low brightness temperatures, while high lightning flash rates are a physically related but instrumentally independent indicator. The geographical locations of these very intense convective storms demonstrate strong regional preferences for certain land areas while they are extremely rare over tropical oceans. Favored locations include the south-central United States, southeast South America, and equatorial Africa. Other regions have extreme storms mainly in specific seasons, such as the Sahel, the Indian subcontinent, and northern Australia. Because intense storms are distributed quite differently from rainfall, these maps provide some new metrics for global models, if they are to simulate the type of convection as a component of our climate system. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

Such variability may cause a substantial societal impact in populated highlands such as in Ethiopia. This study aims at understanding the rainfall diurnal cycle and the orographic driving factors over the Ethiopian highlands using the ALARO-0 regional climate model at convection-permitting resolution, over a period of 21 years. While the evaluation against satellite-based observations shows a too early onset of the model diurnal cycle and a too low nocturnal rainfall, several conclusions can be drawn from the model simulations presented here. Elevation is the most important determining factor for modelled rainfall with increased average rainfall and rainfall per rainfall event towards higher elevations. Ethiopia's simulated summer rain exhibits a pronounced diurnal cycle with the highest rainfall occurring during the early afternoon hours and the minimum values occurring in the late night. Average rainfall and rainfall per rainfall event are substantially larger on the windward sides than on the leeward sides of the mountains, except during the peak hours. The diurnal cycles of temperature and humidity start earlier in the morning and recede later than the cycles of wind speed and rainfall. Moreover, rainfall peaks occur earlier in the day at higher elevations, and at night in valleys and in Afar Triangle. Rain intensities around noon on the leeward side are slightly higher than those on the windward side of the highest mountains (>3000 m). This could be due to delayed onset of cloudiness and larger morning insolation on the leeward side of the mountain, but this needs further study. The prevalence of windward over leeward rainfall, the stark contrast in wind-speed diurnal cycle between windward and leeward slopes, and the early peak hour of surface air and dew point temperature all point towards temperature-induced rather than wind-induced convection. These differences are likely to determine hydrology and vegetation distribution, and farmers economy at large. Hence, the need for a way out from the ‘one-size-fits-all’ agro-ecosystem management approach towards a site-specific policy that takes into account climatic differences.},

   abstract = {We introduce Version 2 of our widely used 1-km Köppen-Geiger climate classification maps for historical and future climate conditions. The historical maps (encompassing 1901–1930, 1931–1960, 1961–1990, and 1991–2020) are based on high-resolution, observation-based climatologies, while the future maps (encompassing 2041–2070 and 2071–2099) are based on downscaled and bias-corrected climate projections for seven shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). We evaluated 67 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and kept a subset of 42 with the most plausible CO2-induced warming rates. We estimate that from 1901–1930 to 1991–2020, approximately 5% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) transitioned to a different major Köppen-Geiger class. Furthermore, we project that from 1991–2020 to 2071–2099, 5% of the land surface will transition to a different major class under the low-emissions SSP1-2.6 scenario, 8% under the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 13% under the high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario. The Köppen-Geiger maps, along with associated confidence estimates, underlying monthly air temperature and precipitation data, and sensitivity metrics for the CMIP6 models, can be accessed at www.gloh2o.org/koppen .},

@article{Camberlin2024,
   abstract = {The occurrence of tropical cyclones (TCs) in the Horn of Africa and nearby areas is for the first time examined to document their contribution to local rainfall and their trends over the period 1990–2020. An average 1.5 TC (of any intensity) per year was observed over the Western Arabian Sea, with two asymmetrical seasons, namely May–June (30% of cyclonic days) and September–December (70%). Case studies reveal that in many instances, TC-related rainfall extends beyond 500 km from the TC center, and that substantial rains occur one to 2 days after the lifecycle of the TC. Despite their rarity, in the otherwise arid to semi-arid context characteristic of the region, TCs contribute in both seasons to a very high percentage of total rainfall (up to 30%–60%) over the northwestern Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden and their coastlines. Over inland northern Somalia, contributions are much lower. TCs disproportionately contribute to some of the most intense daily falls, which are often higher than the mean annual rainfall. A strong increase in the number of TCs is found from 1990 to 2020, hence their enhanced contribution to local rainfall. This increase is associated with a warmer eastern/southern Arabian Sea, a decrease in vertical wind shear, and a strong increase in tropospheric moisture content.},
