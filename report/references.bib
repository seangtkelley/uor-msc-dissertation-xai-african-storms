  abstract  = {In the last years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of AI techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI. Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. This overview examines the existing literature in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. We summarize previous efforts to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition that covers prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which explainability is sought. We then propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at Deep Learning methods for which a second taxonomy is built. This literature analysis serves as the background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the crossroads between data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to XAI with a reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

  abstract  = {Convection over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has been linked to heavy rain and flooding in downstream parts of China. Understanding processes which influence the development of convection on the TP could contribute to better forecasting of these extreme events. TP scale (~1000 km) soil moisture gradients have been shown to influence formation of convective systems over the eastern TP. The importance of smaller-scale (~10 km) variability has been identified in other regions (including the Sahel and Mongolia) but has yet to be investigated for the TP. In addition, compared to studies over flat terrain, much less is known about soil moisture–convection feedbacks above complex topography. In this study we use satellite observations of cold cloud, land surface temperature, and soil moisture to analyze the effect of mesoscale soil moisture heterogeneity on the initiation of strong convection in the complex TP environment. We find that strong convection is favored over negative (positive) land surface temperature (soil moisture) gradients. The signal is strongest for less vegetation and low topographic complexity, though still significant up to a local standard deviation of 300 m in elevation, accounting for 65% of cases. In addition, the signal is dependent on background wind. Strong convective initiation is only sensitive to local (tens of kilometers) soil moisture heterogeneity for light wind speeds, though large-scale (hundreds of kilometers) gradients may still be important for strong wind speeds. Our results demonstrate that, even in the presence of complex topography, local soil moisture variability plays an important role in storm development.},

  abstract  = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the understanding of rainfall extremes by analyzing large datasets and utilizing predictive analytics. AI offers comprehensive insights into rainfall extremes through data collection and analysis, predictive analytics, climate modeling, and the development of early warning systems. This advancement in AI technology has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding and management of rainfall extremes in Africa, leading to improved adaptation and sustainable development strategies in the continent. Amid significant improvements in computer performance, lots of data, and better technology, scientists are focusing on studying extreme rainfall. These complicated and unpredictable weather events have a substantial impact on various socioeconomic sectors. This work showcases the use of different machine learning algorithms to understand rainfall extremes in Africa. Accurate identification and sorting of these events are essential in predicting floods caused by heavy rain in rivers. The work explores the details of critical rain conditions by exploring a case study using rainfall dataset assembled from 22 stations situated in the four agroecological zones in Ghana. Five different ways of training were tested using historical data, for the period 1980-2019. The focus was on accuracy and completeness of the results. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of predicting rain by understanding how rain and no-rain patterns differ in different parts of Africa. The results show that the Random Forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms are good at dealing with unequal numbers of different kinds of data. Decision tree (DT) works quickly, while RF, XGB, and multilayer perceptron consistently show strong skills. However, the not-so-good results of K-nearest neighbor need more investigation. This research improves how to predict rain for informed planning in different parts of Africa.},

The historical maps (encompassing 1901–1930, 1931–1960, 1961–1990, and 1991–2020) are based on high-resolution, observation-based climatologies, while the future maps (encompassing 2041–2070 and 2071–2099) are based on downscaled and bias-corrected climate projections for seven shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). We evaluated 67 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and kept a subset of 42 with the most plausible CO2-induced warming rates. We estimate that from 1901–1930 to 1991–2020, approximately 5% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) transitioned to a different major Köppen-Geiger class. Furthermore, we project that from 1991–2020 to 2071–2099, 5% of the land surface will transition to a different major class under the low-emissions SSP1-2.6 scenario, 8% under the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 13% under the high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario.

  abstract  = {The urban heat island (UHI) effect exacerbates near-surface air temperature (T) extremes in cities, with negative impacts for human health, building energy consumption and infrastructure. Using conventional weather models, it is both difficult and computationally expensive to simulate the complex processes controlling neighbourhood-scale variation of T. We use machine learning (ML) to bias correct and downscale T predictions made by the Met Office operational regional forecast model (UKV) to 100 m horizontal grid length over London, UK. A set of ML models (random forest, XGBoost, multiplayer perceptron) are trained using citizen weather station observations and UKV variables from eight heatwaves, along with high-resolution land cover data. The ML models improve the T mean absolute error (MAE) by up to 0.12°C (11%) relative to the UKV. They also improve the UHI diurnal and spatial representation, reducing the UHI profile MAE from 0.64°C (UKV) to 0.15°C. A multiple linear regression performs almost as well as the ML models in terms of T MAE, but cannot match the UHI bias correction performance of the ML models, only reducing the UHI profile MAE to 0.49°C. UKV latent heat flux is found to be the most important predictor of T bias. It is demonstrated that including more heatwaves and observation sites in training would reduce overfitting and improve ML model performance.},

  abstract  = {Climate science has been revolutionized by the combined effects of an exponential growth in computing power, which has enabled more sophisticated and higher-resolution simulations to be made of the climate system, and an exponential increase in observations since the first weather satellite was put in orbit. Big data and associated algorithms, coalesced under the field of machine learning (ML), offer the opportunity to study the physics of the climate system in ways, and with an amount of detail, that were previously infeasible. Additionally, ML can ask causal questions to determine whether one or more variables cause or affect one or more outcomes and improve prediction skills beyond classical limits. Furthermore, when paired with modelling experiments or robust research on model parameterizations, ML can accelerate computations, increasing accuracy and generating very large ensembles with a fraction of the computational cost of traditional systems. In this Review, we outline the accomplishments of ML in climate physics. We discuss how ML has been used to tackle long-standing problems in the reconstruction of observational data, representation of sub-grid-scale phenomena and climate (and weather) prediction. Finally, we consider the benefits and major challenges of exploiting ML in studying complex systems. Artificial intelligence techniques, specifically machine learning, are being increasingly applied to climate physics owing to the growing availability of big data and increasing computational power. This Review focuses on key results obtained with machine learning in reconstruction, sub-grid-scale parameterization, and weather or climate prediction.},

  abstract  = {Neural networks are a promising technique for parameterizing subgrid-scale physics (e.g., moist atmospheric convection) in coarse-resolution climate models, but their lack of interpretability and reliability prevents widespread adoption. For instance, it is not fully understood why neural network parameterizations often cause dramatic instability when coupled to atmospheric fluid dynamics. This paper introduces tools for interpreting their behavior that are customized to the parameterization task. First, we assess the nonlinear sensitivity of a neural network to lower-tropospheric stability and the midtropospheric moisture, two widely studied controls of moist convection. Second, we couple the linearized response functions of these neural networks to simplified gravity wave dynamics, and analytically diagnose the corresponding phase speeds, growth rates, wavelengths, and spatial structures. To demonstrate their versatility, these techniques are tested on two sets of neural networks, one trained with a superparameterized version of the Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM) and the second with a near-global cloud-resolving model (GCRM). Even though the SPCAM simulation has a warmer climate than the cloud-resolving model, both neural networks predict stronger heating/drying in moist and unstable environments, which is consistent with observations. Moreover, the spectral analysis can predict that instability occurs when GCMs are coupled to networks that support gravity waves that are unstable and have phase speeds larger than 5 m s21. In contrast, standing unstable modes do not cause catastrophic instability. Using these tools, differences between the SPCAM-trained versus GCRM-trained neural networks are analyzed, and strategies to incrementally improve both of their coupled online performance unveiled.},

  abstract  = {The modulation of the rainfall diurnal cycle at intraseasonal and interannual time scales is examined using gridded rainfall data over Eastern Africa and the nearby Indian Ocean for the period 1998–2014. Our focus is on the October-December season which is strongly impacted by both the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (IODM). The effect of the MJO, which is not synchronized across the whole region, is mainly through changes in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle, especially an enhancement of the late afternoon peak in active phases of the MJO. The rainfall phase only shows minor variations between the active and quiescent phases of the MJO, except over the drier regions and the Indian Ocean where the overall diurnal rainfall signal is more uneven. The effect of the positive phase of the IODM (warm western Indian Ocean) on Eastern Africa rainfall is found at any time of the day, but the enhancement is more prominent during the wettest part of the day (generally the afternoon). Substantial changes in the diurnal phase of the rains are found in some land areas away from the coast or from mountain ranges, where the dominant afternoon peak during the negative IODM phase is replaced by a nighttime maximum during the positive phase. Cross-sections and a cluster analysis of diurnal rainfall patterns over Kenya and southern Somalia suggest that this feature may be associated with the development of longer-lived rainfall systems propagating inland from the coast during the IODM positive phase.},

  abstract  = {The occurrence of tropical cyclones (TCs) in the Horn of Africa and nearby areas is for the first time examined to document their contribution to local rainfall and their trends over the period 1990–2020. An average 1.5 TC (of any intensity) per year was observed over the Western Arabian Sea, with two asymmetrical seasons, namely May–June (30% of cyclonic days) and September–December (70%). Case studies reveal that in many instances, TC-related rainfall extends beyond 500 km from the TC center, and that substantial rains occur one to 2 days after the lifecycle of the TC. Despite their rarity, in the otherwise arid to semi-arid context characteristic of the region, TCs contribute in both seasons to a very high percentage of total rainfall (up to 30%–60%) over the northwestern Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden and their coastlines. Over inland northern Somalia, contributions are much lower. TCs disproportionately contribute to some of the most intense daily falls, which are often higher than the mean annual rainfall. A strong increase in the number of TCs is found from 1990 to 2020, hence their enhanced contribution to local rainfall. This increase is associated with a warmer eastern/southern Arabian Sea, a decrease in vertical wind shear, and a strong increase in tropospheric moisture content.},

We propose ForecastNet which uses a deep feed-forward architecture to provide a time-variant model.

This study analyzes drivers of future precipitation changes over East Africa by applying a classification of circulation patterns on 15 historical and future members of the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment. Typical circulation types (CTs) are obtained. Under a high emission scenario, changes in the frequency of occurrence of these CTs attribute for 23% of the total change in precipitation over East Africa by the end of the century. The remaining part (77%) is not related to East African synoptics, e.g. changes in moisture content, local/mesoscale feedbacks, and changes in moisture influx. These other effects comprise increases in precipitation close to the equator and the Somali region, while decreases are found over northwestern Ethiopia, the Sudan region and the lake areas.},

  abstract  = {Climate data are essential in an array of climate research and applications that include analyses of climate variability and trends and modeling the impact of climate variability and change on different socioeconomic activities. However, the use of climate data for research and applications in Africa has been scanty because availability of and access to climate data is very limited. In many parts of Africa, weather stations are sparse and their number has been declining. Besides, the distribution of existing stations is uneven, with most located along major roads. Where data exist, they are often of poor quality with many gaps. There are different efforts underway to overcome these challenges. One of these efforts is the Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) initiative. This initiative works with National Meteorological Services in Africa to improve the availability and quality of climate data by combining quality-controlled station observation with satellite and reanalysis proxies.},

  abstract  = {Singular value decomposition method is used to investigate the covariability between Ethiopian main rainy season [Kiremt, June to September (JJAS)] anomalies and the anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) in Indian Ocean based on precipitation and SST reanalysis datasets. Results show that significant coupled modes of variability exist, with the first dominant coupled mode explaining 49.3% and the second dominant coupled mode explains 12.6% of the total covariance. There is, however, higher correlation between the second dominant coupled modes than the first one. The spatial pattern of the first dominant mode shows a strong positive loading of SST in the central part of Indian Ocean, and below (above) normal rainfall in western (eastern) part of Ethiopia. The second dominant mode exhibits positive phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event, with a strong positive (negative) SST anomaly in the western (southeastern) sector of Indian Ocean. This is associated with below (above) normal rainfall in northwestern (southeastern) region of Ethiopia. This is further affirmed by the correlation between the Dipole Mode Index of IOD and Ethiopian JJAS rainfall, which shows a negative (positive) correlation in the northwestern (southeastern) region. The analysis of the circulation anomalies associated with the pure positive (negative) IOD years are associated with anomalous easterly (westerly) winds over Ethiopia. Further analysis reveals that there is a widespread moisture divergence over Ethiopia and neighboring countries during negative phase of IOD as opposed to the positive phase of IOD which exhibits moisture convergence over the entire south and eastern Ethiopia, including parts of Uganda, Kenya, South Sudan, and western Somalia. The findings from this study give insight into the influence of Indian Ocean on Ethiopian JJAS rainfall.},

  abstract  = {This study examines the projected changes in the characteristics of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in terms of mean state, intensity and frequency, and associated rainfall anomalies over eastern Africa. Two regional climate models driven by the same four global climate models (GCMs) and the corresponding GCM simulations are used to investigate projected changes in teleconnection patterns and East African rainfall. The period 1976–2005 is taken as the reference for present climate and the far-future climate (2070–2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) is analyzed for projected change. Analyses of projections based on GCMs indicate an El Niño-like (positive IOD-like) warming pattern over the tropical Pacific (Indian) Ocean. However, large uncertainties remain in the projected future changes in ENSO/IOD frequency and intensity with some GCMs show increase of ENSO/IOD frequency and intensity, and others a decrease or no/small change. Projected changes in mean rainfall over eastern Africa based on the GCM and RCM data indicate a decrease in rainfall over most parts of the region during JJAS and MAM seasons, and an increase in rainfall over equatorial and southern part of the region during OND, with the greatest changes in equatorial region. During ENSO and IOD years, important changes in the strength of the teleconnections are found. During JJAS, when ENSO is an important driver of rainfall variability over the region, both GCM and RCM projections show an enhanced La Niña-related rainfall anomaly compared to the present period. Although the long rains (MAM) have little association with ENSO in the reference period, both GCMs and RCMs project stronger ENSO teleconnections in the future. On the other hand, during the short rains (OND), a dipole future change in rainfall teleconnection associated with ENSO and IOD is found, with a stronger ENSO/IOD related rainfall anomaly over the eastern part of the domain, but a weaker ENSO/IOD signal over the southern part of the region. This signal is consistent and robust in all global and regional model simulations. The projected increase in OND rainfall over the eastern horn of Africa might be linked with the mean changes in SST over Indian and Pacific Ocean basins and the associated Walker circulations.},

  abstract  = {Global kilometer-scale models represent the future of Earth system modeling, enabling explicit simulation of organized convective storms and their associated extreme weather. Here, we comprehensively evaluate tropical mesoscale convective system (MCS) characteristics in the DYAMOND (DYnamics of the atmospheric general circulation modeled on non-hydrostatic domains) simulations for both summer and winter phases. Using 10 different feature trackers applied to simulations and satellite observations, we assess MCS frequency, precipitation, and other key characteristics. Substantial differences (a factor of 2–3) arise among trackers in observed MCS frequency and their precipitation contribution, but model-observation differences in MCS statistics are more consistent across trackers. DYAMOND models are generally skillful in simulating tropical mean MCS frequency, with multi-model mean biases ranging from −2%–8% over land and −8%–8% over ocean (summer vs. winter). However, most DYAMOND models underestimate MCS precipitation amount (23%) and their contribution to total precipitation (17%). Biases in precipitation contributions are generally smaller over land (13%) than over ocean (21%), with moderate inter-model variability. While models better simulate MCS diurnal cycles and cloud shield characteristics, they overestimate MCS precipitation intensity and underestimate stratiform rain contributions (up to a factor of 2), particularly over land, albeit observational uncertainties exist. Additionally, models exhibit a wide range of precipitable water in the tropics compared to reanalysis and satellite observations, with many models showing exaggerated sensitivity of MCS precipitation intensity to precipitable water. The MCS metrics developed here provide process-oriented diagnostics to guide future model development.},

  abstract  = {In East Africa, climate change and variability have shown a strong impact on sectors such as agriculture, energy, and water. To allow mitigation and adaptation of the possible impacts of the projected change in climate, this study applies a Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM)to generate a high-resolution climate projection, equivalent to future station data, to drive impact assessment models in selected, agricultural intensive, basins of Ethiopia (EthShed), Kenya (KenShed), and Tanzania (TanShed). Observed and large-scale climate variables (predictors)are obtained from the national meteorological agency of Ethiopia and international databases. BROOK90, a physical-based hydrological model, is used to assess the impacts of the projected change in precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature (T-max, and T-min)on the water balance. Based on SDSM, the results show an increase in precipitation, relative to the baseline period (1961–1990), in EthShed (14% - 50%)and KenShed (15% - 86%)and a decrease in TanShed (1.3% - 6.3%)in the 20s (2011–2040), 50s (2041–2070), and 80s (2071–2100)under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). T-max (anomalies up to 3.7 °C)and T-min (anomalies up to 2.76 °C)will be warmer than the baseline period throughout the 21 century in all three basins. In line with the projected change in precipitation and temperature, an increase (decrease)in seasonal and annual streamflow, soil-water, and evaporation in EthShed and KenShed (TanShed)is projected in the 20s, 50s, and 80s. In general, sustainable adaptation measures are required to be developed in a site-specific manner, considering the projected increase in temperature and evaporation in all three basins and a decrease in soil-water and streamflow in TanShed.},

  abstract  = {The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

These data afford a novel assessment of the seasonal and interannual variability of MCSs. Additionally, hourly precipitation data from 16 of those years (2002-17) are used to systematically examine rainfall associated with radar-derived MCS events. The attributes and occurrence of MCSs that pass over portions of the CONUS east of the Continental Divide (ECONUS), as well as five author-defined subregions-North Plains, High Plains, Corn Belt, Northeast, and Mid-South-are also examined. The results illustrate two preferred regions for MCS activity in the ECONUS: 1) the Mid-South and Gulf Coast and 2) the Central Plains and Midwest. MCS occurrence and MCS rainfall display a marked seasonal cycle, with most of the regions experiencing these events primarily during the warm season (May-August). Additionally, MCS rainfall was responsible for over 50% of annual and seasonal rainfall for many locations in the ECONUS. Of particular importance, the majority of warm-season rainfall for regions with high agricultural land use (Corn Belt) and important aquifer recharge properties (High Plains) is attributable to MCSs. These results reaffirm that MCSs are a significant aspect of the ECONUS hydroclimate.},

  abstract  = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract  = {East Africa is particularly vulnerable to weather extremes, with severe weather linked to thousands of deaths per year. Improved forecasts of convective events in this region are urgently needed, from both nowcasting and numerical weather prediction models. Improving these forecasts requires further knowledge of convection in this region. This study aims to improve understanding of convective events in East Africa, based on a six-year climatology of convective life cycles and the associated precipitation. Convective systems are identified as contiguous areas of cold cloud in geostationary satellite measurements over East Africa. A tracking algorithm is used to trace the evolution of the properties of these systems through time and space. Matching the systems to surface precipitation obtained from satellite microwave observations provides insight into how the life cycles of these systems relate to precipitation at the surface. Over the region as a whole, 59% of the accumulated precipitation can be attributed to the tracked convective systems. The majority (81%) of heavy precipitation events ((Formula presented.) 10 mm (Formula presented.) hr−1) are attributable to convective systems, while light rainfall events ((Formula presented.) 1 mm (Formula presented.) hr−1) are not (1.8%). Most of the tracked convective systems have an area less than 400 km2 and last for less than an hour. However, the less frequent larger longer-lived systems produce the majority of the regional accumulated precipitation. Composite life cycles of the tracked systems show rapid intensification and the heaviest precipitation initially, followed by a steady increase in area and weakening in intensity before the system decays. Finally, the Madden–Julian oscillation, which plays a key role in intraseasonal rainfall variability in the region, is also linked to the amount of rainfall due to convective systems through changes in the frequency and properties of these systems.},

  abstract  = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the largescale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

  abstract  = {The largest convective clouds are mesoscale convective systems, which account for a large portion of Earth's cloud cover and precipitation, and the patterns of wind and weather associated with mesoscale convective systems are important local phenomena that often must be forecast on short timescales. They often produce floods. Mesoscale convective systems are generally much larger than the individual cumulonimbus and lines of cumulonimbus discussed in Chapter 8. They develop circulations on the mesoscale, which are larger in scale than the updrafts and downdrafts of individual cumulonimbus clouds. The mesoscale circulations produce large regions of stratiform (nimbostratus) precipitation of the type discussed in Chapter 6. Often the stratiform precipitation regions trail a squall line consisting of convective cells, and a mesoscale convective vortex tends to form in the stratiform region. The heating profile in the stratiform region is positive at upper levels and negative at lower levels due to evaporation and melting of the precipitation particles. The dynamics of mesoscale circulations involve a joint adjustment to the wind shear and thermodynamic stratification of the large scale environment. Gravity-wave dynamics also contribute to the maintenance of mesoscale convective systems. This chapter reviews both the observed structure of mesoscale systems and their unique dynamics. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract  = {The identification of phases of matter is a challenging task, especially in quantum mechanics, where the complexity of the ground state appears to grow exponentially with the size of the system. Traditionally, physicists have to identify the relevant order parameters for the classification of the different phases. We here follow a radically different approach: we address this problem with a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, adversarial domain adaptation. We derive the phase diagram of the whole parameter space starting from a fixed and known subspace using unsupervised learning. This method has the advantage that the input of the algorithm can be directly the ground state without any ad hoc feature engineering. Furthermore, the dimension of the parameter space is unrestricted. More specifically, the input data set contains both labeled and unlabeled data instances. The first kind is a system that admits an accurate analytical or numerical solution, and one can recover its phase diagram. The second type is the physical system with an unknown phase diagram. Adversarial domain adaptation uses both types of data to create invariant feature extracting layers in a deep learning architecture. Once these layers are trained, we can attach an unsupervised learner to the network to find phase transitions. We show the success of this technique by applying it on several paradigmatic models: the Ising model with different temperatures, the Bose-Hubbard model, and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with disorder. The method finds unknown transitions successfully and predicts transition points in close agreement with standard methods. This study opens the door to the classification of physical systems where the phase boundaries are complex such as the many-body localization problem or the Bose glass phase.},

  abstract  = {Low-pressure systems (LPSs) are the primary rainbringers of the South Asian monsoon. Yet, their interactions with the large-scale monsoon circulation, as well as the highly variable land and sea surfaces they pass over, are complex and generally not well understood. In this article, we present a novel, top-down approach to investigate these relationships and quantify their importance in describing LPS behaviour. We also show that, if the approach is sufficiently well posed, it is productive at hypothesis generation. For each of five predictands (i.e., LPS intensification rate, propagation speed/direction, post-landfall survival, peak intensity, and precipitation rate) we train an additive decision-tree ensemble model using the XGBoost algorithm. Shapley value analysis is then applied to the models to determine which variables are important predictors and to establish their relationship with the predictand, with additional analysis following cases of interest. Novel relationships established using this technique include that LPS vorticity intensifies preferentially in the early morning at the same time as the peak in the diurnal cycle of their convection occurs, that vertical wind shear suppresses continued growth of strong LPSs, that large-scale barotropic instability plays an important role in both the inland penetration and peak intensity of LPSs, and that LPS propagation depends on the depth of its vortex with shallower LPSs advected by low-level winds and taller LPSs advected by mid-level winds. We also use this framework to identify and discuss potential new avenues of research for monsoon LPSs.},

  abstract  = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50&nbsp;years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far&nbsp;short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm. AlphaFold predicts protein structures with an accuracy competitive with experimental structures in the majority of cases using a novel deep learning architecture.},

  abstract  = {One of the problems that scholars encounter when conducting research is that data from Africa are poor. Indeed, they either do not exist in a complete sense or they are not of good quality in the sense of lacking validity and reliability. Using various sources of available data on corruption and tourism, we show that lack of quality data in Africa not only limits the continent’s ability to generate a pertinent body of knowledge but also prevents analysts from generating the evidence that policy makers need to make proper decisions in influencing the development of the continent. We go on to argue that the problem of data quality in Africa is due to the lack of research culture rather than just scarcity of resources, as argued in the literature. It is in this context that we advocate for inculcation of research culture in Africa for development of the continent. Related Articles: Asongu, Simplice A., and Jacinta C.

  abstract  = {Soil moisture can feed back on rainfall through the impact of surface fluxes on the environment in which convection develops. The vast majority of previous research has focused on the initiation of convection, but in many regions of the world, the majority of rain comes from remotely triggered mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Here we conduct a systematic observational analysis of soil moisture feedbacks on propagating MCSs anywhere in the world and show a strong positive impact of drier soils on convection within mature MCSs. From thousands of storms captured in satellite imagery over the Sahel, we find that convective cores within MCSs are favored on the downstream side of dry patches ≥200 km across. The effect is particularly strong during the afternoon–evening transition when convection reaches its diurnal peak in intensity and frequency, with dry soils accounting for an additional one in five convective cores. Dry soil patterns intensify MCSs through a combination of convergence, increased instability, and wind shear, all factors that strengthen organized convection. These favorable conditions tend to occur in the vicinity of a surface-induced anomalous displacement of the Sahelian dry line/intertropical discontinuity, suggesting a strong link between dry line dynamics and soil moisture state. Our results have important implications for nowcasting of severe weather in the Sahel and potentially in other MCS hotspot regions of the world.},

  abstract  = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are the major source of extreme rainfall over land in the tropics and are expected to intensify with global warming. In the Sahel, changes in surface temperature gradients and associated changes in wind shear have been found to be important for MCS intensification in recent decades. Here we extend that analysis to southern West Africa (SWA) by combining 34 years of cloud-top temperatures with rainfall and reanalysis data. We identify clear trends in intense MCSs since 1983 and their associated atmospheric drivers. We also find a marked annual cycle in the drivers, linked to changes in the convective regime during the progression of the West African monsoon. Before the peak of the first rainy season, we identify a shear regime where increased temperature gradients play a crucial role for MCS intensity trends. From June onward, SWA moves into a less unstable, moist regime during which MCS trends are mainly linked to frequency increase and may be more influenced by total column water vapor. However, during both seasons we find that MCSs with the most intense convection occur in an environment with stronger wind shear, increased low-level humidity, and drier midlevels. Comparing the sensitivity of MCS intensity and peak rainfall to low-level moisture and wind shear conditions preceding events, we find a dominant role for wind shear. We conclude that MCS trends are directly linked to a strengthening of two distinct convective regimes that cause the seasonal change of SWA MCS characteristics. However, the convective environment that ultimately produces the most intense MCSs remains the same.},

Regional differences in forecast accuracy are particularly relevant if weather forecasts are considered as an important tool to help reduce the negative effects of future climate change such as mortality from extreme temperature events. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive global analysis of the accuracy of short-term numerical weather predictions of temperature and relate our findings to both existing economic inequalities and inequities in global weather monitoring infrastructure. We report three main results: First, temperature forecasts are currently substantially more accurate in high income countries than in low income countries. A seven-day-ahead forecast in a high-income country is on average more accurate than a one-day-ahead forecast in a low income country. Second, while forecast accuracy has improved steadily between 1985 and the present - with the largest increases in the 1990s - there is a persistent gap between high income and low income countries. Third, the infrastructure for weather observations is highly unequally distributed across countries, with fewer land-based weather stations and radiosondes in poorer countries. These inequalities grow even larger when lower reporting rates are taken into account. Remedying these differences in infrastructure would help close the forecast accuracy gap.},

As a charismatic technology, artificial intelligence (A.I.) has been a common topic of these debates. This paper presents a case study of how the discourses and principles of ethics of technology development—specifically, of A.I.— were mobilized to form trust among actors in the fields of computer science, risk communication, and weather forecasting. My analysis draws on sociology of expertise and the literature on ethics of A.I. to ask: how emerging networks of expertise use ethics to overcome mistrust in technology? And, what role does the institutionalization of those networks play in the process of trust formation? I situate this discussion on the NSF Institute for Research on Trustworthy A.I. The Institute is positioned as a mediating organization with the goal of increasing trust in this technology primarily the weather forecasting community, but also among the public. I show that first, to better understand how scientific and professional fields react to increased automation it is crucial to unpack the historical backdrop of how the professional identity of those experts has been shaped by a relationship with computer-supported modeling. To this end, I situate the discussion in the long-standing tensions between computer modelling and tacit knowledge in weather forecasting. Second, I argue that the means of establishing trust in A.I. propagated by the actors in the paper, which pair norms of explainability to sensitivity to professional intuitions and domain-specific conventions, rely on a series of “mutual orientations” (Edwards, 1996). I mobilize the concept of “mutual orientations” to describe the work of tailoring the ethics of A.I. to the specific requirements of weather sciences, but also to the vision of a national strategy of investment in this technology.},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

The basic ideas of numerical forecasting and climate modeling were developed about a century ago, long before the first electronic computer was constructed. There were several major practical obstacles to be overcome before numerical prediction could be put into practice. A fuller understanding of atmospheric dynamics allowed the development of simplified systems of equations; regular radiosonde observations of the free atmosphere and, later, satellite data, provided the initial conditions; stable finite difference schemes were developed; and powerful electronic computers provided a practical means of carrying out the prodigious calculations required to predict the changes in the weather. Progress in weather forecasting and in climate modeling over the past 50 years has been dramatic. In this presentation, we will trace the history of computer forecasting through the ENIAC integrations to the present day. The useful range of deterministic prediction is increasing by about one day each decade, and our understanding of climate change is growing rapidly as Earth System Models of ever-increasing sophistication are developed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract  = {In recent years, artificial intelligence and specifically artificial neural networks (NNs) have shown great success in solving complex, nonlinear problems in earth sciences. Despite their success, the strategies upon which NNs make decisions are hard to decipher, which prevents scientists from interpreting and building trust in the NN predictions; a highly desired and necessary condition for the further use and exploitation of NNs’ potential. Thus, a variety of methods have been recently introduced with the aim of attributing the NN predictions to specific features in the input space and explaining their strategy. The so-called eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is already seeing great application in a plethora of fields, offering promising results and insights about the decision strategies of NNs. Here, we provide an overview of the most recent work from our group, applying XAI to meteorology and climate science. Specifically, we present results from satellite applications that include weather phenomena identification and image to image translation, applications to climate prediction at subseasonal to decadal timescales, and detection of forced climatic changes and anthropogenic footprint. We also summarize a recently introduced synthetic benchmark dataset that can be used to improve our understanding of different XAI methods and introduce objectivity into the assessment of their fidelity. With this overview, we aim to illustrate how gaining accurate insights about the NN decision strategy can help climate scientists and meteorologists improve practices in fine-tuning model architectures, calibrating trust in climate and weather prediction and attribution, and learning new science.},

In this study we assess the capabilities of National Hydrological and Meteorological Services (NMHSs) of the SADC region in performing NWP and climate modelling activities in support of generation of science-based climate information to the ever-growing number of stakeholders in the region. We first administered an online questionnaire to 15 SADC NMHSs gauging their status in terms of modelling capabilities. The online questionnaire was then followed by site visits to verify the online responses. Finally, we convened a validation workshop with representatives from all visited NMHSs. The results from the survey revealed a great disparity in the region in terms of capacity for performing NWP and climate modelling activities. Only 60% of the NMHSs in the region are either running or testing NWP models. Climate modelling activities are relegated to the second plan as only about 20% of NMHSs are dynamically downscaling seasonal forecasts and generating climate change projections. The challenges impeding running NWP and climate models in the SADC NMHSs are many and include lack of appropriate infrastructure (hardware and software), inadequate meteorological telecommunications and communication systems for rapid data exchange, lack of qualified staff, and insufficient budget to cater for acquisition and maintenance of meteorological equipment. More investment in the Meteorological sector is needed for NMHSs in the SADC region to provide timely and accurate climate information.},

An intriguing class of explanations is through counterfactuals, hypothetical examples that show people how to obtain a different prediction. We posit that effective counterfactual explanations should satisfy two properties: feasibility of the counterfactual actions given user context and constraints, and diversity among the counterfactuals presented. To this end, we propose a framework for generating and evaluating a diverse set of counterfactual explanations based on determinantal point processes. To evaluate the actionability of counterfactuals, we provide metrics that enable comparison of counterfactual-based methods to other local explanation methods. We further address necessary tradeoffs and point to causal implications in optimizing for counterfactuals. Our experiments on four real-world datasets show that our framework can generate a set of counterfactuals that are diverse and well approximate local decision boundaries, outperforming prior approaches to generating diverse counterfactuals. We provide an implementation of the framework at https://github.com/microsoft/DiCE.},

  abstract  = {The ERA5 environments of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), tracked from satellite observations, are assessed over a 20-yr period. The use of a large set of MCS tracks allows us to robustly test the sensitivity of the results to factors such as region, latitude, and diurnal cycle. We aim to provide novel information on environments of observed MCSs for assessments of global atmospheric models and to improve their ability to simulate MCSs. Statistical analysis of all tracked MCSs is performed in two complementary ways. First, we investigate the environments when an MCS has occurred at different spatial scales before and after MCS formation. Several environmental variables are found to show marked changes before MCS initiation, particularly over land. The vertically integrated moisture flux convergence shows a robust signal across different regions and when considering MCS initiation diurnal cycle. We also found spatial scale dependence of the environments between 200 and 500 km, providing new evidence of a natural length scale for use with MCS parameterization. In the second analysis, the likelihood of MCS occurrence for given environmental conditions is evaluated, by considering all environments and determining the probability of being in an MCS core or shield region. These are compared to analogous non-MCS environments, allowing discrimination between conditions suitable for MCS and non-MCS occurrence. Three environmental variables are found to be useful predictors of MCS occurrence: total column water vapor, midlevel relative humidity, and total column moisture flux convergence. Such relations could be used as trigger conditions for the parameterization of MCSs, thereby strengthening the dependence of the MCS scheme on the environment.},

  abstract  = {Topoclimate, orographically enhanced rain on windward slopes and leeward rain shadows, control rainfall variability in tropical mountains. Such variability may cause a substantial societal impact in populated highlands such as in Ethiopia. This study aims at understanding the rainfall diurnal cycle and the orographic driving factors over the Ethiopian highlands using the ALARO-0 regional climate model at convection-permitting resolution, over a period of 21 years. While the evaluation against satellite-based observations shows a too early onset of the model diurnal cycle and a too low nocturnal rainfall, several conclusions can be drawn from the model simulations presented here. Elevation is the most important determining factor for modelled rainfall with increased average rainfall and rainfall per rainfall event towards higher elevations. Ethiopia's simulated summer rain exhibits a pronounced diurnal cycle with the highest rainfall occurring during the early afternoon hours and the minimum values occurring in the late night. Average rainfall and rainfall per rainfall event are substantially larger on the windward sides than on the leeward sides of the mountains, except during the peak hours. The diurnal cycles of temperature and humidity start earlier in the morning and recede later than the cycles of wind speed and rainfall. Moreover, rainfall peaks occur earlier in the day at higher elevations, and at night in valleys and in Afar Triangle. Rain intensities around noon on the leeward side are slightly higher than those on the windward side of the highest mountains (>3000 m). This could be due to delayed onset of cloudiness and larger morning insolation on the leeward side of the mountain, but this needs further study. The prevalence of windward over leeward rainfall, the stark contrast in wind-speed diurnal cycle between windward and leeward slopes, and the early peak hour of surface air and dew point temperature all point towards temperature-induced rather than wind-induced convection. These differences are likely to determine hydrology and vegetation distribution, and farmers economy at large. Hence, the need for a way out from the ‘one-size-fits-all’ agro-ecosystem management approach towards a site-specific policy that takes into account climatic differences.},

  abstract  = {Increased frequencies and intensities of extreme weather events have negatively impacted climate-sensitive socio-economic sectors in Kenya and larger Equatorial East Africa (EEA). Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) influence intra-seasonal weather variability over Kenya although less attention has been given to its effect on extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, which have increased in frequency and intensity. Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) was used in this work as proxy data for rainfall to study the geographical distribution and circulation anomalies associated with MJOs and their impacts on extreme weather events. Extreme weather events are identified using the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI), based on sc-PDSI, 2013/2014 and 2017/2018 as the drought and flood years, respectively. The background power spectral analysis reveals that MJOs are more dominant during the March–May (MAM) season than other seasons. The variance analysis depicted that the maximum power of MJO-filtered OLR is cantered within the tropical Indian Ocean, maritime continent and the tropical Pacific Ocean. Upper tropospheric (200 hPa) wind signatures give a clear Matsuno-Gill-type circulation compared to the lower tropospheric wind flows. Thus, the signatures can be used to develop a dynamic MJO index for prediction purposes. There exists a weak direct relationship between MJO and sc-PDSI; however, the influence may result from its modulation of atmospheric circulation as illustrated by the wind and velocity potential patterns before and after the passage of the convective MJO phase.},

  abstract  = {Eastern Africa exhibits bimodal rainfall consisting of long rains (March–May) and short rains (October–December), changes in which have profound socioeconomic and environmental impacts. In this Review, we examine the drivers and corresponding impacts of Eastern African rainfall variability. Remote teleconnections, namely the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole, exert a dominant influence on interannual variability. From the mid-1980s to 2010, the long rains have tended toward a drier state (trends of −0.65 to&nbsp;−2.95 mm season−1&nbsp;year−1), with some recovery thereafter, while the short rains have become wetter since the mid 1980s (1.44 to 2.36 mm season−1 year−1). These trends, overlain by substantial year-to-year variations, affect the severity and frequency of extreme flooding and droughts, the stability of food and energy systems, the susceptibility to water-borne and vector-borne diseases, and ecosystem stability. Climate model projections of rainfall changes differ, but there is some consensus that the short rains will deliver more rainfall than the long rains by 2030–2040, with implications for sustaining agricultural yields and triggering climate-related public health emergencies. Mitigating the impacts of future Eastern African climate requires continued investments in agriculture, clean water, medical and emergency infrastructures, and development and adoption of adaptation strategies, as well as targeted early-warning systems driven by improved meteorological observations. Rainfall variability in Eastern Africa is associated with considerable social and environmental impacts, including threats to water, energy and food security. This Review outlines the drivers of this rainfall variability, their corresponding impacts, and potential future changes with anthropogenic warming.},

  abstract  = {The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) was shown in Part I to have a significant impact on both East African rainy seasons at pentad time-scale. The case of the 'long rains' (March-May) is further examined by considering both shorter (daily) and longer (interannual) time-scales. Based on composite analyses, extreme daily rainfall events in the Highland (west) and in the coastal (east) regions of Equatorial East Africa (Kenya and Tanzania) are extracted. Low-level westerly wind anomalies are seen to accompany wet events in the west and easterly ones in the east. These opposite circulation anomalies preferentially occur at distinct phases of the MJO, which indicates that the latter has a major influence on rainfall at the daily time-scale. However, this influence undergoes significant year-to-year variations. It is found that the common variance between smoothed rainfall time series (5-day low-pass filter) and MJO indices varies from 5% to 53% in the Highland region. Significantly lower air temperatures in the upper troposphere are recorded during the MJO cycles that present the highest common variance with East African rainfall. Such a cooling is seen to be related to the Kelvin wave propagation in the upper layers which favours upward atmospheric motion over the region. At the interannual time-scale, fluctuations in MJO amplitude contribute to the March-May rainfall variability, and 44% of the March-May seasonal rainfall variance in the 1979-95 period in East Africa is explained by this parameter. Years of high MJO amplitude are characterized by earlier onset of the rains, and higher seasonal amounts. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.},

There is an urgent need to evaluate these models from a meteorological perspective, but access to the output of these models is limited. We detail two new resources to facilitate access to AIWP model output data in the hope of accelerating the investigation of AIWP models by the meteorological community. First, a 3-yr (and growing) reforecast archive beginning in October 2020 containing twice daily 10-day forecasts for FourCastNet v2-small, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast Operational is now available via an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket through NOAA’s Open Data Dissemination (NODD) program (https://noaa-oar-mlwp-data.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This reforecast archive was initialized with both the NOAA’s Global Forecast System (GFS) and ECMWF’s Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) initial conditions in the hope that users can begin to perform the feature-based verification of impactful meteorological phenomena. Second, real-time output for these three models is visualized on our web page (https://aiweather.cira.colostate.edu) along with output from the GFS and the IFS. This allows users to easily compare output between each AIWP model and traditional, physics-based models with the goal of familiarizing users with the characteristics of AIWP models and determine whether the output aligns with expectations, is physically consistent and reasonable, and/or is trustworthy. We view these two efforts as a first step toward evaluating whether these new AIWP tools have a place in forecast operations.},

  abstract  = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

  abstract  = {The XWS (eXtreme WindStorms) catalogue consists of storm tracks and model-generated maximum 3 s wind-gust footprints for 50 of the most extreme winter windstorms to hit Europe in the period 1979-2012. The catalogue is intended to be a valuable resource for both academia and industries such as (re)insurance, for example allowing users to characterise extreme European storms, and validate climate and catastrophe models. Several storm severity indices were investigated to find which could best represent a list of known high-loss (severe) storms. The best-performing index was Sft, which is a combination of storm area calculated from the storm footprint and maximum 925 hPa wind speed from the storm track. All the listed severe storms are included in the catalogue, and the remaining ones were selected using Sft. A comparison of the model footprint to station observations revealed that storms were generally well represented, although for some storms the highest gusts were underestimated. Possible reasons for this underestimation include the model failing to simulate strong enough pressure gradients and not representing convective gusts. A new recalibration method was developed to estimate the true distribution of gusts at each grid point and correct for this underestimation. The recalibration model allows for storm-to-storm variation which is essential given that different storms have different degrees of model bias. The catalogue is available at www.europeanwindstorms.org.},

  abstract  = {Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather models and long-term climate emulators. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI weather model FourCastNet on the 1979–2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3–5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018–2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3–5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3–5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather and climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models. Other types of weather extremes need to be similarly investigated. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI models to reliably provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful TCs, and, possibly, other weather extremes.},

@article{Taylor2017,
  abstract  = {Since 1982, extreme daily rainfall in the western Sahel has increased persistently, owing to a warmer Sahara which has led to increased wind shear and an increase in intense storms. A warming climate is expected to increase the frequency of extreme rainfall events because warmer air can support higher humidity, but other mechanisms may also be at work. Christopher Taylor et al. show that increases in extreme rainfall in the western Sahel region of Africa since 1982 are driven by a larger gradient in temperature across the region caused by a warmer Sahara desert to the north. In turn, the sharper gradient increases wind shear and seems to have led to the frequency of mesoscale convective systems—which are exactly the kind of weather systems likely to generate extreme rainfall—tripling since 1982. The spatial patterns of global warming are likely to further increase the temperature gradient and intensify mesoscale convective systems, leading to more extreme rainfall events. The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify under global warming1, with studies reporting more frequent extreme rain events in many regions of the world2,3,4, and predicting increases in future flood frequency5. Such early, predominantly mid-latitude observations are essential because of shortcomings within climate models in their depiction of convective rainfall6,7. A globally important group of intense storms—mesoscale convective systems (MCSs)8—poses a particular challenge, because they organize dynamically on spatial scales that cannot be resolved by conventional climate models. Here, we use 35 years of satellite observations from the West African Sahel to reveal a persistent increase in the frequency of the most intense MCSs. Sahelian storms are some of the most powerful on the planet9, and rain gauges in this region have recorded a rise in ‘extreme’17 daily rainfall totals. We find that intense MCS frequency is only weakly related to the multidecadal recovery of Sahel annual rainfall, but is highly correlated with global land temperatures. Analysis of trends across Africa reveals that MCS intensification is limited to a narrow band south of the Sahara desert. During this period, wet-season Sahelian temperatures have not risen, ruling out the possibility that rainfall has intensified in response to locally warmer conditions. On the other hand, the meridional temperature gradient spanning the Sahel has increased in recent decades, consistent with anthropogenic forcing driving enhanced Saharan warming10. We argue that Saharan warming intensifies convection within Sahelian MCSs through increased wind shear and changes to the Saharan air layer. The meridional gradient is projected to strengthen throughout the twenty-first century, suggesting that the Sahel will experience particularly marked increases in extreme rain. The remarkably rapid intensification of Sahelian MCSs since the 1980s sheds new light on the response of organized tropical convection to global warming, and challenges conventional projections made by general circulation models.},

  abstract  = {The variability of East African short rains (October–December) has profound socioeconomic and environmental impacts on the region, making accurate seasonal rainfall predictions essential. We evaluated the predictability of East African short rains using model ensembles from the multi-system seasonal retrospective forecasts from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). We assess the prediction skill for 1- to 5-month lead times using forecasts initialized in September for each year from 1993 to 2016. Although most models exhibit significant mean rainfall biases, they generally show skill in predicting OND (October–December) precipitation anomalies across much of East Africa. However, skill is low or absent in some northern and western parts of the focus area. Along the East African coasts near Somalia and over parts of the western Indian Ocean, models demonstrate skill throughout the late winter (up to December–February), likely due to the persistence of sea surface temperature anomalies in the western Indian Ocean. Years when models consistently outperform persistence forecasts typically align with the mature phases of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and/or Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). This latter mode, when tracked using the Dipole Mode Index, is generally able to predict the sign of the rainfall anomaly in all models. Despite East Africa’s proximity to the west pole of the IOD, the correlation between short rains and IOD maximizes when both east and west are considered. This finding confirms previous studies based on observational datasets, which indicate that broader-scale IOD variability associated with changes in the Walker Circulation, rather than local SST fluctuations, is the primary driver behind East African rainfall.},

  abstract  = {Global climate models (GCMs) are critical tools for understanding and projecting climate variability and change, yet the performance of these models is notoriously weak over much of tropical Africa. To improve this situation, process-based studies of African climate dynamics and their representation in GCMs are required. Here, we focus on summer rainfall of eastern Africa (SREA), which is crucial to the Ethiopian Highlands and feeds the flow of the Blue Nile River. The SREA region is highly vulnerable to droughts, with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) being a leading cause of interannual rainfall variability. Adequate understanding and accurate representation of climate features that influence regional variability is an important but often neglected issue when evaluating models. We perform a process-based evaluation of GCMs, focusing on the upper-troposphere tropical easterly jet (TEJ), which has been hypothesized to link ENSO to SREA. We find that most models have an ENSO-TEJ coupling similar to observed, but the models diverge in their representation of TEJ-SREA coupling. Differences in the latter explain the majority (80%) of variability in ENSO teleconnection simulation across the models. This is higher than the variance explained by rainfall coupling with the Somali jet (44%) and African easterly jet (55%). However, our diagnostics of the leading hypothesized mechanism in the models-variability in divergence in the TEJ exit region-are not consistent across models and suggest that a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of TEJ-precipitation coupling should be a priority for studies of climate variability and change in the region.},

  abstract  = {East African precipitation is characterized by a dry annual mean climatology compared to other deep tropical land areas and a bimodal annual cycle with the major rainy season during March-May (MAM; often called the "long rains") and the second during October-December (OND; often called the "short rains"). To explore these distinctive features, ERA-Interim data are used to analyze the associated annual cycles of atmospheric convective stability, circulation, and moisture budget. The atmosphere over East Africa is found to be convectively stable in general year-round but with an annual cycle dominated by the surface moist static energy (MSE), which is in phase with the precipitation annual cycle. Throughout the year, the atmospheric circulation is dominated by a pattern of convergence near the surface, divergence in the lower troposphere, and convergence again at upper levels. Consistently, the convergence of the vertically integrated moisture flux is mostly negative across the year, but becomes weakly positive in the two rainy seasons. It is suggested that the semiarid/arid climate in East Africa and its bimodal precipitation annual cycle can be explained by the ventilation mechanism, in which the atmospheric convective stability over East Africa is controlled by the import of low MSE air from the relatively cool Indian Ocean off the coast. During the rainy seasons, however, the off-coast sea surface temperature (SST) increases (and is warmest during the long rains season) and consequently the air imported into East Africa becomes less stable. This analysis may be used to aid in understanding overestimates of the East African short rains commonly found in coupled models.},

However, these complex models often lack inherent transparency and interpretability, acting as “black boxes” that impede user trust and hinder further model improvements. As such, interpretable machine learning techniques have become crucial in enhancing the credibility and utility of weather and climate modeling. In this paper, we review current interpretable machine learning approaches applied to meteorological predictions. We categorize methods into two major paradigms: (1) Post-hoc interpretability techniques that explain pre-trained models, such as perturbation-based, game theory based, and gradient-based attribution methods. (2) Designing inherently interpretable models from scratch using architectures like tree ensembles and explainable neural networks. We summarize how each technique provides insights into the predictions, uncovering novel meteorological relationships captured by machine learning. Lastly, we discuss research challenges and provide future perspectives around achieving deeper mechanistic interpretations aligned with physical principles, developing standardized evaluation benchmarks, integrating interpretability into iterative model development workflows, and providing explainability for large foundation models.},

Previous studies investigated the relationship of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Pacific Ocean (Niño 3.4 region) to occurrence of meteorological and hydrological droughts in the Nile Basin. In this paper we focus on the dependence of occurrence of droughts and floods in the upper catchment of the Blue Nile on the timing of El Niño and La Niña events. Different events start at different times of the year and follow each other, exhibiting different patterns and sequences. Here we study the impact of these timing and temporal patterns on the Blue Nile droughts and floods. The comparison between the discharge measurements (1965-2012) at the outlet of the upper catchment of the Blue Nile and the El Niño index shows that when an El Niño event is followed by a La Niña event, there is a 67% chance for occurrence of an extreme flood. Furthermore, we also found that 83% of El Niño events starting in April-June resulted in droughts in the upper catchment of the Blue Nile. Although the current study is limited by the reduced number of samples, we propose that observations as well as global model forecasts of SST during this season could be used in seasonal forecasting of the Blue Nile flow. © Author(s) 2014.},

  abstract  = {Tropical cyclone (TC) genesis is a problem of great significance in climate and weather research. Although various environmental conditions necessary for TC genesis have been recognized for a long time, prediction of TC genesis remains a challenge due to complex and stochastic processes involved during TC genesis. Different from traditional statistical and dynamical modeling of TC genesis, in this study, a machine learning framework is developed to determine whether a mesoscale convective system (MCS) would evolve into a tropical cyclone. The machine learning models 1) are built upon a number of essential environmental pre-dictors associated with MCSs/TCs, 2) predict whether MCSs can become TCs at different lead times, and 3) provide information about the relative importance of each predictor, which can be conducive to discov-ering new aspects of TC genesis. The results indicate that the machine learning classifier, AdaBoost, is able to achieve a 97.2% F1-score accuracy in predicting TC genesis over the entire tropics at a 6-h lead time using a comprehensive set of environmental predictors. A robust performance can still be attained when the lead time is extended to 12, 24, and 48 h, and when this machine learning classifier is separately applied to the North Atlantic Ocean and the western North Pacific Ocean. In contrast, the conventional approach based on the genesis potential index can have no more than an 80% F1-score accuracy. Furthermore, the machine learning classifier suggests that the low-level vorticity and genesis potential index are the most important predictors to TC genesis, which is consistent with previous discoveries.},

On the basis of radar observations from the USA and China, our model produces physically plausible precipitation nowcasts with sharp multiscale patterns over regions of 2,048 km × 2,048 km and with lead times of up to 3 h. In a systematic evaluation by 62 professional meteorologists from across China, our model ranks first in 71% of cases against the leading methods. NowcastNet provides skilful forecasts at light-to-heavy rain rates, particularly for extreme-precipitation events accompanied by advective or convective processes that were previously considered intractable. &nbsp;A new nowcasting model unifies physical-evolution schemes and deep-learning methods to accurately predict precipitation with lead times of up to 3 h, including extreme-precipitation events and weather systems that were previously considered intractable with physics-based numerical methods.},

  abstract  = {Weather forecasting, a vital task for agriculture, transportation, energy, etc., has evolved significantly over the years. Comprehensive surveys play a crucial role in synthesizing knowledge, identifying trends, and addressing emerging challenges in this dynamic field. In this survey, we critically examines machine learning (ML)-based weather forecasting methods, which demonstrate exceptional capability in handling complex, high-dimensional datasets and leveraging large volumes of historical and real-time data, enabling the identification of subtle patterns and relationships among weather variables. Research on specific tasks such as global weather forecasting, downscaling, extreme weather prediction, and how to combine machine learning methods with physical principles are very active in the current field. However, several unresolved or challenging issues remain, including the interpretability of models and the ability to predict rare weather events. By identifying these gaps, this research provides a roadmap for advancing machine learning-based weather forecasting techniques to complement and enhance weather prediction results.},

  abstract  = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs), tropical storms (TSs), and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are important weather phenomena that often threaten society through heavy precipitation and strong winds. Despite their potentially vital role in global and regional hydrological cycles, their contributions to long-term mean and extreme precipitation have not been systematically explored at the global scale. Using observational and reanalysis data, and NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s new high-resolution global climate model, we quantify that despite their occasional (13%) occurrence globally, AR, TS, and MCS days together account for ∼55% of global mean precipitation and ∼75% of extreme precipitation with daily rates exceeding its local 99th percentile. The model reproduces well the observed percentage of mean and extreme precipitation associated with AR, TS, and MCS days. In an idealized global warming simulation with a homogeneous SST increase of 4 K, the modeled changes in global mean and regional distribution of precipitation correspond well with changes in AR/TS/MCS precipitation. Globally, the frequency of AR days increases and migrates toward higher latitudes while the frequency of TS days increases over the central Pacific and part of the south Indian Ocean with a decrease elsewhere. The frequency of MCS days tends to increase over parts of the equatorial western and eastern Pacific warm pools and high latitudes and decreases over most part of the tropics and subtropics. The AR/TS/MCS mean precipitation intensity increases by ∼5% K21 due primarily to precipitation increases in the top 25% of AR/TS/MCS days with the heaviest precipitation, which are dominated by the thermodynamic component with the dynamic and microphysical components playing a secondary role.},

  abstract  = {A deep learning based method augmented by prior knowledge of tropical cyclones (TCs), called DeepTCNet, is introduced to estimate TC intensity and wind radii from infrared (IR) imagery over the North Atlantic Ocean. While standard deep learning practices have many advantages over conventional analysis approaches and can produce reliable estimates of TCs, the data-driven models informed by machine-readable physical knowledge of TCs could achieve higher performance. To this end, two approaches are explored to develop the physics-Augmented DeepTCNet: (i) infusing the auxiliary physical information of TCs into models for single-Task learning and (ii) learning auxiliary physical tasks for multitask learning. More specifically, augmented by auxiliary information of TC fullness (a measure of the radial decay of the TC wind field), the DeepTCNet yields a 12% improvement in estimating TC intensity over the nonaugmented one. By learning TC wind radii and auxiliary TC intensity task simultaneously, the model s wind radii estimation skill is improved by 6% over only learning four wind radii tasks and by 9% over separately learning a single wind radii task. The evaluation results showed that the DeepTCNet is in-line with the Satellite Consensus technique (SATCON) but systematically outperforms the advanced Dvorak technique (ADT) at all intensity scales with an averaged 39% enhancement in TC intensity estimation. The DeepTCNet also surpasses the Multiplatform Tropical Cyclone Surface Wind Analysis technique (MTCSWA) with an average improvement of 32% in wind radii estimation.},

  abstract  = {The instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite have been observing storms as well as rainfall since December 1997. This paper shows the results of a systematic search through seven full years of the TRMM database to find indicators of uncommonly intense storms. These include strong (> 40 dBZ) radar echoes extending to great heights, high lightning flash rates, and very low brightness temperatures at 37 and 85 GHz. These are used as proxy variables, indicating powerful convective updrafts. The main physical principles supporting this assertion involve the effects of such updrafts in producing and lofting large ice particles high into the storm, where TRMM's radar easily detects them near storm top. TRMM's passive microwave radiometer detects the large integrated ice water path as very low brightness temperatures, while high lightning flash rates are a physically related but instrumentally independent indicator. The geographical locations of these very intense convective storms demonstrate strong regional preferences for certain land areas while they are extremely rare over tropical oceans. Favored locations include the south-central United States, southeast South America, and equatorial Africa. Other regions have extreme storms mainly in specific seasons, such as the Sahel, the Indian subcontinent, and northern Australia. Because intense storms are distributed quite differently from rainfall, these maps provide some new metrics for global models, if they are to simulate the type of convection as a component of our climate system. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},
